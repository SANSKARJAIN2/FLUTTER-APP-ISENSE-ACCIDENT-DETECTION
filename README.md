Isense accident detection module
This application is developed to detect a motor vehicle accident and show the nearest help centre available and once found it sends a notification to drag the attention of the user or the nearby first responders so that they can take the victim to the centre without wasting much time in identification of the medical centre.

#CURRENT STAGE:

Back-end is done.

Improving the UI/UX of the application also filed the issue for UI/UX. :)


TECHNOLOGY SAVING LIVES.  :)
